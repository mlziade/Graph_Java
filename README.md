# Graph_Java
Graph structure, witch can create graphs, add in nodes, add in connections and verify if they are SIMPLE, REGULAR, BIPARTITE or COMPLETE

Graph inputs are done throug a linked list of all of the nodes, as well as a linked list of neighbors nodes for each node

A regular graph is one wich the number of neighbors of all nodes is equal. 
In a complete graph for each vertex of the graph, exists a connection to all of the the remaining nodes. 
In a bipartite graph there are 2 groups of nodes, in wich two nodes of the same group can't be connected. 
Simple graphs are neither of the above.
